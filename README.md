Final code is located under file "[BMEGOONS]_FinalCode" in Github repository.

Files in repository beginning with "AFIB, AFL, APB, NSR, SVTA" are noisy ECG waveforms that must be downloaded and saved in a folder called "BME 3053C Project".

If not saved with file name above, the location must be changed in the code. This can be done by editing line 4 in the code from "myfolder = 'BME 3053C Project'" to whichever new folder you have created with ECG data.
